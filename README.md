# nodeVoteShirt
This is a shitty project for a shitty task, completed in less than an hour.
We basically generate a database of random tokens, create QR codes out of these tokens, hand them out IRL and let people vote which shirts they want. Nice.

## Thanks
I would like to thank the moodle team for not providing an authentication API. You could have prevented this.
